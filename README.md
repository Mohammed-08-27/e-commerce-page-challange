this my first time using react + vite; I wanted to get confident using vanilla javascript and css. 
I thought that frameworks are just making the app or website too heavy, but I was wrong... 
Frameworks make coding easier.
### in this project 
I useed react-icons and tailwinds
useEffect, useState and useRef Hooks to control the nav, the cart and the count...
I made a slider and I use in the main page and also in Lightbox element execpt I added css propirties pointer-events to disable some functionality in the main slider.
I did not use api context as I am not sure that I can handle. However, I am planning to do in my next projects...
